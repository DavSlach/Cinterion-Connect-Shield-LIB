/*
This file is a part of the LTE Cinterion Connect Shield library for Arduino.

This is a copy of HardwareSerial implementation from Arduino library
with added modification that allows to use RTS/CTS signal to control the data flow.

There is added new overloaded "begin()" method which takes a GPIO numbers for RTC/CTS signals:
void LTEConnectShieldHwSerial::begin(unsigned long baud, uint8_t config, uint8_t rts, uint8_t cts)

This driver creates a global objects which reflects the serial peripherals 
regards to platform capabilities, in the same way as original version.
